## Feedback

It would be better if the classes contain less tasks. Most of the tasks were monotonic  and  time-consuming without special educational value.  I suggest for future preparing short instruction where all dependencies will be explained, and 3-4 more complicated task. For example, to place the satellite on orbit which meet defined requirements. 

## TODOs

- [x] Update VTS Timeloop instruction
- [x] Add instruction for TLE2nadir plugin
- [x] Add instruction for GMAT CCSDS_OEM import in VTS or usage of TLE2CCSDS plugin in VTS timeloop.
- [ ] Add screenshot for Output tree (not tab!)
- [ ] Add a reminder to save the project after initial config!!!
- [ ] Explain how the lab raport should look like, maybe add a (LaTeX?) template?
- [ ] The students add their own spacecraft - either ask them to modify the DefaultSC, or update the instruction to show them how to select their spacecraft in all of the subsequent propagators, plots and raports.
- [ ] When creating new spacecraft, add step to change the spacecraft color
- [ ] Add instruction how to use mouse on the earth plot, lol
- [ ] Add sun to the OrbitView 
- [ ] Explicitly state that the ElapsedTime condition for the propagator needs to be 86400 or ElapsedDays = 1
